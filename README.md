## Authentication System

Authentication systems are security measures put in place to secure data and systems by requiring additional input beyond username and password for users to access a system. By providing this additional input, authentication systems help ensure that **users are who they say they are**.

### What is web3 Auth?

Web3 authentication plugin allows Secure Login with a **secure decentralized system into your website** using blockchain wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Wallet Connect QR code, Phantom, Pera, Ledger, and Trezor or any EVM Compatible Wallet and restricts access to content based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
